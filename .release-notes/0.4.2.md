## Add experimental `packages` field to corral.json

The addition of the `packages` field in an experimental fashion is the first step towards a bundle knowing, at a first class level, what packages it provides. The information will be used during documentation generation as well as for releasing bundles not as git/hg repos but as a compact format (like .tar.gz) that isn't the entire repo.

This field is subject to change and shouldn't be used by anyone who isn't currently a pony committer until such time as the features that rely on it are finalized.
